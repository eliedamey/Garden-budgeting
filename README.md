# Bucketed Banking: The Garden Budgeting App

## What is this project?
A gamified budgeting and savings tracker that transforms financial discipline into **a living, evolving garden**.  
Users create spending and savings buckets, track their money in real time, and earn **growth points** by sticking to budgets and hitting savings milestones. These points grow plants, trees, and artifacts in a virtual garden — turning financial progress into something beautiful and rewarding.

## Why am I building it?
I’ve recently started learning more about **personal finance, budgeting, and investing**. When creating my own budget, I found it frustrating to do so much **manual calculation during the month** just to figure out how much I had left in each category.  

Most budgeting apps try to auto-categorize purchases, but:  
- They don’t always include **goals or reward systems**.  
- Auto-categorization isn’t reliable (e.g., if I buy snacks at a gas station, it’s tracked as “gas” instead of “food”).  

That’s why I thought it would be powerful if users could **choose their spending category instantly at the point of purchase** — making budgets more accurate and meaningful.  

This project is my attempt to bring those ideas together into a **portfolio-ready demo**.

## What does it do? (MVP Vision)
- **Spending Buckets**: Track categories like food, gas, or entertainment.  
- **Savings Buckets**: Track progress toward goals like vacations or emergency funds.  
- **Rewards System**: Earn points for staying on budget or reaching savings milestones.  
- **Garden Growth**: Use points to grow plants, trees, and build a beautiful personal garden that reflects your financial health.

## How do I run it?
*(Work in progress — will be updated once coding starts)*  

Planned steps:  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Install dependencies.  
3. Run the backend server.  
4. Run the frontend app.  
5. Log in as a demo user and explore budgeting features.  

For now, this section is a placeholder until the initial codebase is set up.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Define data models (Users, Buckets, Transactions, Rewards, Garden).  
- [ ] Build basic backend API for buckets & transactions.  
- [ ] Create frontend UI for bucket management.  
- [ ] Implement reward → garden growth logic.  
- [ ] Add visualizations for garden growth.  
- [ ] Polish README with setup steps, screenshots, and demo.
